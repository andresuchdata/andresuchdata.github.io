# Andre Suchitra - Official Website

This is my personal website, built with Hugo. I use it to share my thoughts, experiences, and projects related to software development.

## Background

I've been a software developer for over 10 years, and I usually did not document my learning and experiences. Here onwards, I will try to write down my learning and experiences.


## Tech Stack
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Static Site Generator
